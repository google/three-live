# Changelog

All notable changes to **Three-Live** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   **Talk-to-Select (B2b-4), multi-select:** `el.selectedMeshes` holds the
    selection (`selected-mesh` stays its first entry); `setSelection(el,
    names, {mode: 'replace' | 'add' | 'remove' | 'toggle' | 'clear'})` changes
    it; the viewer highlights every selected mesh; `three-live-select` now
    carries `{mesh, meshes, added, removed, source, query?}`. With
    `ai-select-on-tap`, Shift / Ctrl / Cmd-tap or a long press adds to the
    selection. `editScene` (web and the shared Rust core) accepts several
    selected meshes and rejects edits that lose any of them. Removing
    `selected-mesh` now also clears the highlight. `xr-live-viewer.min.js`
    budget: `< 55 KB gz` (was `< 54`).

-   **Talk-to-Select (B2b-4), voice selection without a model call:** say
    "select the two red chairs on the left" and the tier-1 matcher resolves it
    against the loaded scene: names (with synonyms and plurals), material
    colors, camera-relative left / right / front / back, top / bottom,
    biggest / smallest / tallest, ordinals ("the second mug"), counts
    ("both", "three"), "all … except …", and lists ("the lamp and the sofa").
    It also recognizes relations ("the cup next to the sofa") and leaves them
    to a model. Push-to-talk (`startVoiceEdit`) understands "select / also
    select / deselect … / clear the selection" and "select X and make it red",
    which edits right away only when the reference was unambiguous; otherwise
    it asks "Which one: A or B?" and changes nothing. New
    `el.selectByVoice(query, {mode})`, `resolveSelection`, `matchSelection`,
    `parseVoiceCommand`. The Rust core implements the same matcher
    (`ai_call` ops `select` and `parse_command`); a shared fixture keeps the
    two identical.

-   **Tap & Speak on Android and iOS (B2b-2/3):** `ThreeLiveAIEditor` (Android)
    and `AIEditor` (iOS/visionOS) bring `editScene` / `undoEdit` to native apps
    with any `ai-chat` code model; tap-to-select via `toggleSelection`;
    push-to-talk `VoiceEditController` (platform speech recognition and TTS);
    and `AIVoiceSession` realtime voice over `ai-realtime` or `gemini-live`
    with `edit_scene` / `undo_edit` tools. The prompt, reply parsing, edit
    validation, and voice protocols live in a new shared Rust core
    (`ai_edit.rs`, `ai_voice.rs`) exposed as `three_live_ai_call` (C, freed
    with `three_live_free_string`) and `ThreeCompiler.nativeAiCall` (JNI), with
    tests that keep the prompt and tools identical to the web plugin.
    `MicrophoneStreamer` now takes any sample rate and callback (the
    `XRGeminiLiveController` constructor still works); on Android it records
    with `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` for echo cancellation while model audio plays.

-   **Tap & Speak voice scene editing (`three-live-ai`):** `ai-select-on-tap`
    makes tapping a mesh set `selected-mesh` (tap again to clear);
    `el.startVoiceEdit()` is push-to-talk with the browser's speech recognizer
    and a spoken result; `el.connectVoice({provider, url})` starts a realtime
    voice conversation over `ai-realtime` (any server speaking the Realtime
    WebSocket event protocol) or `gemini-live`, where the voice model calls an
    `edit_scene` / `undo_edit` tool that runs `editScene` with your code model.
    Includes microphone capture, gapless playback with barge-in, selection
    context, and a built-in `ai-voice-button` (or `slot="voice-button"`).
    Progress is reported as `three-live-voice` events and selection changes as
    `three-live-select`. Budgets: `three-live-ai` `< 10 KB gz`,
    `three-live-full` `< 151 KB gz`, `xr-live-full` `< 251 KB gz`; core bundles
    are unchanged.

-   **`three-live-cli gym` (closed-loop agent gym without MCP):**
    `gym reset scene.js --session ep.json` and
    `gym step --session ep.json --actions '[...]' --ticks 30` play a scene one
    command per step for shell-tool agents (the session file embeds the scene
    and every step and is replayed deterministically on each call);
    `gym play scene.js` is a JSON-lines stdin/stdout loop for scripts and RL
    harnesses. Both accept `--watch` and `--frame out.png`. Observation
    positions are now rounded to 0.1 mm (rotations to 1e-5) in both the CLI
    and the MCP tools.

-   **Closed-loop agent gym (`three_live_gym_reset`, `three_live_gym_step`,
    `three_live_gym_close` MCP tools):** Agents can play a scene step by step
    instead of scripting it up front ("gym" as in the OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium
    reset/step pattern; no ML involved). Each step applies actions, advances the
    deterministic 60 Hz simulation by `ticks`, and returns body states,
    `reward` (score delta), the `events`, `audioCues`, and `newObjectives`
    fired during the step, `done`, and an optional rendered frame. State
    carries over between steps (a new resumable `SimStepper` in the compiler),
    so a step on a static scene takes well under a millisecond; scenes with
    `animate(t)` / `requestAnimationFrame` hooks are re-sampled once per step.

-   **Bring-your-own-LLM scene editing (`three-live-ai.min.js`, `< 5 KB gz`):**
    `el.editScene(instruction, { selection, maxRepairs, dryRun, signal })`
    sends the current scene script and selected mesh to any LLM, compiles the
    reply in the element's sandbox before touching the live scene, retries once
    with the exact error, rejects edits that empty the scene or silently drop
    the selected mesh, then hot-swaps (`el.undoEdit()` reverts). Providers:
    `ai-chat` (any Chat Completions-compatible endpoint via `ai-endpoint` /
    `ai-model`, or `createAIChatProvider()`) or any custom
    `{ complete({ messages, signal }) }` object. Emits `three-live-edit-start`
    and `three-live-edit` events. Included in `three-live-full` and
    `xr-live-full` (budgets raised to `< 146 KB gz` and `< 246 KB gz`); core
    bundles are unchanged.

-   **Deterministic PBR material presets (`THREE.ProceduralTexture`,
    `userData.xr.material`):** 11 seamlessly tiling presets (`wood`, `marble`,
    `brick`, `concrete`, `brushedMetal`, `rust`, `leather`, `fabric`,
    `carbonFiber`, `checkerboard`, `grid`) return `{ map, normalMap,
    roughnessMap, metalnessMap }` to spread into `MeshStandardMaterial`, with
    `color`, `color2`, `scale`, `seed`, `roughness`, `normalStrength`, and
    `size` options. `mesh.userData.xr = { material: 'wood' }` bakes a preset
    tinted by the mesh's material color. Identical options share textures and
    `normalStrength: 0` skips the normal map (each preset otherwise uses 3 of
    the 16 scene textures). Native Rust kernels (CLI, MCP,
    Android, iOS) and the JS kernels (Web workers) are byte-identical, pinned by
    cross-language hash tests; each preset generates in under 20 ms at
    256 px. `three-live-procedural.min.js` budget raised to `< 28 KB gz`
    (`three-live-full` `< 142 KB gz`, `xr-live-full` `< 242 KB gz`); core
    bundles are unchanged.

-   **Reference-driven authoring (`three_live_render` `reference`, `three-live-cli
    render --reference`):** renders the scene at a reference image's aspect
    ratio into a `REFERENCE | RENDER | OVERLAY | SILHOUETTE DIFF` comparison
    sheet (auto-aligned overlay on plain/transparent backgrounds) with
    scale/translation-invariant `silhouetteIou`, `aspectError`,
    `silhouetteReliable`, and actionable `guidance`, so agents can match photos,
    mockups, sketches, and blueprints in a few turns. Accepts PNG (all color
    types, bit depths, `tRNS`, Adam7) and JPEG (baseline/progressive, EXIF
    orientation) from local paths or `data:` URIs; remote URLs are never
    fetched. Adds the `build_from_reference` MCP prompt.

### Changed

-   **Faster simulation, gym, and filmstrips (warm JS engine reuse):**
    `three_live_sim`, `three-live-cli sim`, temporal `render --frames`, and the
    agent gym now reuse the thread's warm JS engine (as GLB/USDZ conversion
    already did) instead of building a new one per call, which took ~210 ms.
    Gym steps on animated scenes drop from ~220 ms to ~18 ms and gym reset /
    one-shot `sim` calls from ~0.45 s to ~0.25 s; output is unchanged.

### Fixed

-   **Inline `<script type="text/three">` scenes now load however the bundle
    is included.** With a `defer`, `type="module"`, `async`, or end-of-`<body>`
    bundle, elements already in the page upgraded before the bundle registered
    its script runner and showed "Script execution requires three-live/full";
    with a classic `<script>` in `<head>`, the element upgraded before its
    inline script was parsed and rendered nothing. The inline scene now runs
    after the bundle finishes evaluating (or on `DOMContentLoaded`), unless a
    newer load (`src`, `executeScript`) started first. `three-live.min.js`
    budget: `< 73 KB gz` (was `< 72`).

-   **Warm-engine isolation:** top-level `var` and function declarations from
    one scene are no longer visible to the next scene compiled on the same
    reused engine (they are non-configurable globals that the sandbox reset
    could not delete; they are now blanked).

-   **`validate` / `render` now report texture-quota overflows:** scenes whose
    materials reference more than `SECURITY_3D_MAX_TEXTURES` (16) unique images
    get a `TL105` error up front instead of passing validation and then failing
    `.glb` / `.usdz` export.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.2] - 2026-11-08 (Beta)

### Added

-   **Shareable Playground Links & QR Codes (`#p=`, `#s=z:`):** The `/three/`
    and `/xr/` web playgrounds open scenes directly from the URL fragment:
    `#p=<preset>` for built-in and gallery scenes, and `#s=z:<payload>` for any
    scene script (raw DEFLATE, unpadded base64url; decoded client-side via
    `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` so scene code never touches a server).
    Added **🔗 Share**, a centered **📱 Run on phone** QR code modal, a
    persistent **Compiled in X ms** header badge, a 3-tab **Camera / Mesh /
    Spatial & AR** inspector, and **🏯 AI Pagoda** (`#p=pagoda`) and **🚜 AI
    Forklift Drill** (`#p=forklift`) gallery presets.
-   **Native Outputs Panel:** Live mesh count, `.glb` and `.usdz` byte sizes,
    and copyable Android (Kotlin), iOS (Swift), and Web HTML snippets for the
    active scene in `/three/`.
-   **`three-live-cli link` & `three_live_link` MCP Tool:** Validates a scene
    and returns a shareable playground URL (`#s=z:<deflate-base64url>`) plus a
    dependency-free ISO/IEC 18004 Model 2 QR code (UTF-8 half-block terminal
    rendering via `--qr` and vector SVG via MCP).
-   **USDZ Embedded Texture Packaging (`UsdUVTexture`):** Packages embedded
    `.glb` and procedural `THREE.DataTexture` images (PNG, JPEG, WebP) as
    64-byte-aligned entries inside `.usdz` archives and emits connected
    `UsdUVTexture` + `UsdPrimvarReader_float2` shader graphs on both Web and
    Rust compilers.
-   **60 Hz Temporal Simulation Harness (`three-live-cli sim` &
    `three_live_sim`):** Headless deterministic simulation runner stepping
    `KHR_interactivity`, `xr-live-sim` rigid-body physics, character
    controllers, and objectives with optional contact-sheet filmstrips.
-   **`Object3D` World-Transform Helpers & `defineModelViewer()`:** Added
    `getWorldPosition`, `getWorldQuaternion`, `getWorldScale`,
    `getWorldDirection`, `localToWorld`, `worldToLocal`,
    `Quaternion.identity()`, `defineModelViewer()` custom-element alias, and
    native partial-arc (`thetaStart`/`thetaLength`/`phiStart`/`phiLength`/`arc`)
    support across `CylinderGeometry`, `SphereGeometry`, `RingGeometry`,
    `CircleGeometry`, and `TorusGeometry`.

### Fixed

-   **XR Collect Game Drone Patrols:** Updated `Drone_Patrol` and `Drone_Chaser`
    routes so enemy drones circulate continuously around inner walls instead of
    stopping at the far corners.
-   **macOS Quick Look (`.usdz`) Button Label:** Clarified the desktop Safari
    AR button label and tooltip when downloading `.usdz` for Finder Quick Look.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.1] - 2026-11-07 (Beta)

### Added

-   **Built-In Model Context Protocol (MCP) Stdio Server
    (`three-live-cli mcp`)**: Added a zero-dependency JSON-RPC 2.0 MCP server in
    `compiler/src/mcp.rs` supporting both newline-delimited JSON and
    `Content-Length` framing for Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and
    MCP Inspector
    (`claude mcp add three-live -- npx -y -p three-live three-live-cli mcp`):
    -   `three_live_validate` — Runs the Three.js compiler, schema checker, and
        3D spatial/frustum/grounding/collision linter (`TL100`–`TL402`).
    -   `three_live_render` — Renders headless 4-up orthographic/camera contact
        sheets (`quad`), single views, or temporal/turntable animations and
        returns native MCP `image/png` / `image/gif` base64 content blocks
        directly into vision-capable agent context windows.
    -   `three_live_convert` — Compiles Three.js / HTML / `.glb` to `.glb` or
        64-byte-aligned Apple `.usdz`.
    -   `three_live_sim` — Steps deterministic 60 Hz `KHR_interactivity` graphs,
        `xr-live-sim` rigid-body physics, character controllers, and objectives
        with optional keyframe filmstrips.
    -   Exposes `three-live://docs/authoring-guide` (`resources/read`) and
        `author_three_live_scene` (`prompts/get`), plus `server.json` (Official
        MCP Registry), `smithery.yaml`, and `.mcp.json`.
-   **Procedural `THREE.DataTexture` Support (`Web`, `Rust`, `GLB`, `USDZ`)**:
    Added `THREE.DataTexture` compilation (`RGBAFormat`, `RGBFormat`,
    `LuminanceFormat`, `RepeatWrapping` / `ClampToEdgeWrapping`), inline PNG
    data-URI serialization in `.glb`, `avgColor` material tinting in `.usdz`,
    and software rasterizer sampling in `three-live-cli render`.
-   **Distance-Based Level-of-Detail (`lod` / `THREE.LOD` / `MSFT_lod`)**: Added
    multi-tier distance switching with hysteresis, far-distance culling,
    automatic vertex-clustering mesh decimation (`decimateGeometry`), and
    `MSFT_lod` / `KHR_node_visibility` export across Web, Android
    (`LodController.kt`), iOS (`LodController.swift`), and the Rust compiler.
-   **3D Spatial Audio Emitters (`spatial-audio` / `KHR_audio_emitter`) & 60 Hz
    Rigid-Body Physics (`rigid-body`)**: Added 8 zero-asset ambient spatial loop
    presets, `KHR_audio_emitter` / USDZ `SpatialAudio` export, and deterministic
    60 Hz Sequential Impulse rigid-body dynamics across Android, iOS, and Web.
-   **Mobile-First Documentation & Animated Hero Showcase**: Redesigned
    `README.md` to lead with native Android (Google Filament & Jetpack XR
    SceneCore), iOS/visionOS (Apple RealityKit), and `three-live-cli` / MCP,
    with an animated 4-stage hero showcase GIF
    (`docs/assets/hero-showcase.gif`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.3.0] - 2026-11-05 (Beta)

### Added

-   **Graduated from Developer Preview (Alpha) to Beta**: Stabilized the core
    TypeScript, Rust, Swift/RealityKit, and Kotlin/Android XR APIs across
    `three-live`, `xr-live`, and `three-live-compiler`.
-   **Zero-Install `npx three-live-cli` Launcher (`bin/three-live-cli.js`)**:
    Added `bin.three-live-cli` to `package.json` so AI coding agents and web
    developers can run `npx three-live-cli validate | render | sim` without a
    local Rust toolchain. Automatically locates local release/debug builds or
    downloads and caches the platform binary from GitHub Releases into
    `~/.cache/three-live/v<version>/`.
-   **Cross-Platform Visual Regression Golden Baselines**: Added perceptual RMSE
    and SSIM (`compareRmse`, `compareSsim` in `compiler/src/rasterizer.rs`) and
    deterministic golden assertions across `Orbital Spheres`, `Quantum Core`,
    `Architecture`, `CAD Flange` (`THREE.CSG`), and `Game Simulator` so Web,
    Android, and iOS presets stay pixel-aligned in CI.
-   **Canonical `userData` Trait Schema & JSON Schema Export (`xr-trait-schema`)**:
    Added a single typed validator (`validateTraits`) and JSON Schema 2020-12
    generator (`generateTraitJsonSchema`, `three-live-cli schema`) shared across
    Web (`xr-live`), Rust (`compiler/src/linter.rs`), Android (`XRSceneLoader`),
    and iOS (`RealityKitSceneLoader`), with typo suggestions (`collectable` ->
    `collectible`, ` anchor` -> `anchor`, ` exploded` -> `explode`) and dynamic
    node-name reference checks (`patrolTargets`, `followTarget`, `fleeTarget`).
-   **WebGL Context Loss Recovery & GPU Resource Disposal**:
    -   Added automatic `webglcontextlost` / `webglcontextrestored` handling on
        `WebGLRenderer` and `<three-live>` (pausing animation loops on loss,
        invalidating stale GPU state maps, and recompiling shaders/programs,
        textures, VAOs/VBOs, shadows, and post-processing targets on restore
        while dispatching `contextlost` / `contextrestored` `CustomEvent`s).
    -   Added `renderer.disposeScene(root)` and `renderer.getMemoryStats()` for
        deterministic GPU memory reclamation and leak auditing across repeated
        `<three-live>` and `ThreeLiveStudio` mount/unmount cycles.
-   **Native Rust Acceleration for Primitives & `THREE.CSG`**: Accelerated
    `PlaneGeometry`, `TorusGeometry`, and `THREE.CSG` (`subtract`, `union`,
    `intersect`) in the Rust/Boa compiler (`compiler/src/primitives.rs` and
    `compiler/src/csg.rs`), achieving up to 17.5x faster compilation on
    boolean-heavy CAD scenes (`39.2 ms` -> `2.24 ms`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.2.4] - 2026-11-05

### Added

-   **AI-First Testing & Verification Toolkit (`three-live-cli`)**:
    -   `three-live-cli validate --json`: Headless JS scene execution with
        structured `TL1xx–TL4xx` diagnostics (`TL101` syntax error, `TL102`
        unknown `THREE.*` class with typo suggestions, `TL103` runtime error,
        `TL104` no visible geometry, `TL105` 250 ms execution ceiling, `TL201`
        unknown `xr-live-sim` trait, `TL202` missing `Player` character,
        `TL301–TL307` spatial/camera/overlap/floor linter warnings).
    -   `three-live-cli render`: Pure-Rust headless software rasterizer
        producing 4-up contact sheets (`--view=quad --grid --annotations` with
        Camera, Front +Z, Top +Y with frustum cone, and Iso 45° panels),
        time-stepped horizontal filmstrips (`--frames=N --duration=T`),
        interactive trigger verification (`--trigger-select=<node>`), and
        animated GIFs (`--output=out.gif`).
    -   `three-live-cli sim`: Headless `xr-live-sim` physics, AI steering, and
        CAD exploded-view step runner (`--actions`, `--snapshots`, `--json`)
        with full event trace logging (`onCollect`, `onDamage`, `onScoreChange`,
        `onWin`, `onLose`).

### Fixed

-   **Consistent counter-clockwise rotation (`Orbital Spheres`)**: Updated
    `Orbital Spheres` orbit speed to `-0.4` across Web, iOS, and Android presets
    so all demo scenes rotate counter-clockwise around `+Y`.
-   **Headless `THREE.CSG` & TypedArray performance in Boa**: Optimized
    `ShapeGeometry`, `ExtrudeGeometry`, `TextGeometry`, and chained
    `THREE.CSG.subtract` operations with direct typed-array population, YZ beam
    culling, and polygon caching.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [1.2.3] - 2026-11-04

### Fixed

-   **`EXT_meshopt_compression` is now spec-compliant** on Web, Android, and
    iOS: vertex codec v0/v1, index buffer and index sequence codecs, and the
    `OCTAHEDRAL` / `QUATERNION` / `EXPONENTIAL` / `COLOR` filters are byte-exact
    with meshoptimizer, so `gltfpack` files load. Adds
    `KHR_meshopt_compression`, `KHR_mesh_quantization` attribute dequantization,
    `UNSIGNED_BYTE` indices, and `KHR_texture_transform` baking for
    `TEXCOORD_0`. `encodeMeshoptBuffer` now emits spec streams.
-   **IK joints rotate:** web IK runs on the glTF node graph (mesh-less `Group`
    joints resolve and child meshes follow), and Web / Android / iOS rotate each
    joint by the weighted shortest arc instead of only moving joint positions.
-   **Gaussian splats render at their true size** (3σ half-extent with an
    `exp(-0.5 m²)` falloff) on all platforms.
-   **`EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` draws with one `drawElementsInstanced`** per
    primitive instead of one draw call per instance.
-   **`KHR_materials_variants`** switching re-resolves custom shaders (unlit,
    clearcoat, sheen, ...) and transmission for the selected material.
-   **WebGL context loss** is handled: rendering pauses and the viewer restores
    programs, plugin GPU state, the last model, and the environment.
-   **`exposure`** is now a linear pre-tone-mapping multiplier (model-viewer
    semantics) instead of scaling image-based lighting only.

### Added

-   **iOS post-processing:** `XRLivePostProcessor` /
    `XRLiveRealityKitSession.enablePostProcessing(on:)` render `tone-mapping`
    and `bloom` on `ARView` via `renderCallbacks.postProcess` + Core Image, and
    `outline` traits render as inverted-hull rims on iOS 18 / visionOS 2.

### Fixed

-   Fixed `mat3NormalFromMat4` in `three-live/src/math.ts` to write $3 \times 3$
    cofactors in column-major order so rotated meshes keep stable world-space
    normals during turntable rotation.
-   Paused `orbit` trait motion when `autoRotate` (`Start Spin` / `Pause Spin`)
    is disabled.
